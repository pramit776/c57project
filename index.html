            My hobby is drawing. I love to draw with different colours. Drawing gives me happiness. My most favourite time is when I come back from school because at that time I get free time to paint. I also love to paint fruits like mango, orange and banana. My mother motivates me to draw more and more. In my school also, everyone loves my drawings. </p></section>
